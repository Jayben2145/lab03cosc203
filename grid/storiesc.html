        <u><h2>Leaving Home</h2></u> 
        <p>Today I travel for Antarctica to meet my distant cousins.</p>
        <p>I have packed my scarf, a $5 note, and a pair of flippers.</p>

        <u><h2>Journey South</h2></u>
        <p>As I swam southbound, I passed by two fish deep in conversation.</p>
        <p>The first fish said to the other</p>
        <blockquote>Above this sea of ours there is another sea, with creatures swimming in it‚Äîand they live there even as we live here.</blockquote>
        <p>The second fish replied,</p>
        <blockquote>Ridiculous! We both know that everything that leaves our sea and stays out of it, dies. What proof have you of other lives in other seas?</blockquote>
        <p>I rose to the surface for some fresh air.</p>

        <u><h2>My Arrival</h2></u>
        <p>I have safely arrived upon the shores of a blindingly white place, whiter even than the audience of a Miley Cyrus concert. No concert greeted my arrival however, only snow, ice, and wind welcomed me to this foreign land.</p>

        <u><h2>Lunch Hour</h2></u>
        <p>At sunrise, I looked at my shadow and said,</p>
        <blockquote>Today, I will have an entire school of salmon for lunch</blockquote>
        <p>And all morning I went about looking for salmon.</p>
        <p>But at noon I saw my shadow again - and said,</p>
        <blockquote>Even one goldfish would do.</blockquote>

        <u><h2>The Wind</h2></u>
        <p>I said to the wind</p>
        <blockquote>How tedious and monotonous you are! Can you not blow any other way but in my face? You disturb my sleep and my emotional well-being.</blockquote>
        <p>But the wind did not answer. It only laughed around me.</p>

        <u><h2>Leopard Seals</h2></u>
        <p>Today I passed by a company of Leopard Seals. As I approached, they were too preoccupied with themselves to notice me. I paused nearby. Then arose in the midst of the company a large, grave seal who began a proclamation,</p>
        <blockquote>Brethren, pray ye; and when ye have prayed again and yet again, nothing doubting, verily then it shall rain penguins!</blockquote>
        <p>And when I heard this, I laughed in my heart and turned from them, saying to myself,</p>
        <blockquote>O blind and foolish seals, has it not been foretold that that which raineth for prayer is not penguins but fish!</blockquote>

        <u><h2>Doing a blackflip!</h2></u>
        <p>Today I was trying to go down a slope to dive into the water, ended up doing a pretty sick backflip!</p>
        <p>Too bad no one was around to see it, ah well. Got some pretty nice fish though.</p>
